**Future changes**
- Make the calculation more secure. Currently using 'eval()' function for calculation. As per https://medium.com/techtofreedom/the-eval-function-in-python-a-powerful-but-dangerous-weapon-ba44e39fa9e2, this is not a reccommeded method due to securit issues. However, as the idea behind the mini-project was to learn how to create a simple desktop application using python, eval() was used.
